Alexander Dalheimer is a Pre-Doc in the PARTISAN project. His dissertation focuses on the causes of partisan conflict and affective polarization. He explores both micro and macro-level explanations for the increasing animosity between supporters of different parties. Specifically, he examines the roles of partisan (meta-)perceptions, identity, policy disagreements, the impact of radical right parties, and local party competition. Alexander is passionate about quantitative and computational methods and tries to combine observational and experimental data. He employs a wide variety of techniques, including regressions, quasi-experimental methods, and computational text-as-data approaches.
