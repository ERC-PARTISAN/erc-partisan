Isabella Rebasso is a PostDoc in the PARTISAN project. Isabellaâ€™s work is at the intersection of psychology and political science: emotions, political information processing and sophistication, personality, gender, and political identities. She got her PhD from the University of Amsterdam where she studied the cognitive roots of emotional responses to political issues and the question how emotions in politics differ from emotions we feel in our personal lives. She uses a variety of methods, from experiments to machine-learning approaches, usually trying to combine experimental and observational methods to study these phenomena and to identify their underlying mechanisms.
