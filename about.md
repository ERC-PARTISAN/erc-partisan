PARTISAN is a project funded by the European Research Council, which aims to investigate partisan prejudice in European multiparty systems. Partisan prejudice can be described as the extent to which citizens hold negative attitudes towards outgroup party supporters. Such prejudice is widespread: many people have stereotypical views of and dislike the supporters of certain parties, sometimes amounting to outright partisan hostility. Partisan prejudice also presents a challenge for liberal democracy. It deepens societal rifts, lowers social trust, weakens the acceptance of elite compromise and leads to discrimination and social ostracism. This challenge is urgent at a time of political division and democratic backsliding, yet, partisan prejudice is barely studied, particularly in Europe. 

The overall research question of PARTISAN is: What are the origins and consequences of partisan prejudice in European multiparty democracies, and how can it be reduced? More specifically, PARTISAN aims to study five aspects of partisan prejudice: 

- **Prevalence** (RQ1): How prevalent and how strong are partisan stereotypes and partisan prejudice in European multiparty systems?
-	**Origins** (RQ2): What are the origins of partisan stereotypes and prejudice? 
-	**Political Consequences** (RQ3): What are the political consequences of partisan prejudice? 
-	**Societal Consequences** (RQ4): What are the societal consequences of partisan prejudice? 
-	**Remedies** (RQ5): How can the effects of partisan prejudice be reduced?

PARTISAN will provide a novel theoretical framework and rigorous empirical evidence for understanding partisan prejudice, with the ambition of fundamentally altering how voters and parties are studied in multiparty systems. The theoretical framework posits that objective characteristics of party supporters form the basis of partisan stereotypes, but that these linkages are filtered through individual perceptions and moderated by party- and country-level characteristics. Based on this framework, this project will provide ground-breaking evidence on the prevalence and origins of partisan prejudice and assess its political and societal consequences, including for political participation, discrimination and social cohesion. PARTISAN will also provide political and societal actors with evidence on different ways to reduce partisan prejudice. 

The project will implement new measurement tools in a cross-national survey and in experiments conducted in population-based surveys and in the field. Innovative experimental designs will be used to rigorously assess the origins and consequences of partisan prejudice, as well as potential remedies.
